qtutils
=======

A collection of various Qt-based classes and code snippets that I decided to extract in a standalone library for use across my Qt applications. 

Taskbar progress is probably the only module that might be of interest to the community. It allows using Windows Vista / 7 / 8 taskbar button progress indicator feature in a Qt-compatible way. There's also a class for easy reflection of an existing QProgressBar state in the taskbar.

Currently there's only implementation for Windows, Mac OS implementation is planned.
